## Stakeholder:

 A marketing team at a technology company.

# Business Overview

Letâ€™s understand a Sentiment Analysis problem from a business standpoint. The good news is: with the power of the internet, businesses today get a huge number of customer feedback through their business website, social media page, business listings, etc. However, the bad news is: a majority of businesses do not even know how to use this information to improve themselves.

# Business Problem 

Our team has been tasked by our stakeholders to build a model that focuses on understanding consumer sentiment toward Apple and Google products. The objective is to gain deep insights into the emotions and sentiments expressed by users of Apple and Google products. This analysis will provide valuable information to drive marketing strategies, enhance brand perception, and improve customer satisfaction initiatives specifically tailored to our target audience. 

# Objectives

Our main objective is to build a specialized sentiment analysis model designed to specifically analyze Twitter sentiments pertaining to Google and Apple products. 

### The specific business objectives to be answered include:

What is the overall sentiment towards Apple and Google products on Twitter?
Are there any recurring themes or topics associated with positive or negative sentiments towards these brands?
Are there any notable differences in sentiment between Apple and Google products?

### Why is Twitter Sentiment Analysis Important?

Understanding Customer Feedback: By analyzing the sentiment of customer feedback, companies can identify areas where they need to improve their products or services.

Reputation Management: Sentiment analysis can help companies monitor their brand reputation online and quickly respond to negative comments or reviews.

Political Analysis: Sentiment analysis can help political campaigns understand public opinion and tailor their messaging accordingly.

Crisis Management: In the event of a crisis, sentiment analysis can help organizations monitor social media and news outlets for negative sentiment and respond appropriately.

Marketing Research: Sentiment analysis can help marketers understand consumer behavior and preferences, and develop targeted advertising campaigns

# Dataset Description

The data is in CSV format. In computing, a comma-separated values (CSV) file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas.

Attribute Information

tweet text: The tweets in the given dataset

emotion in a tweet is directed at The tweets collected from various sources and the types of devices associated with('Negative emotion or positive emotion)

emotion directed at a brand or product:  having either positive or negative sentiments associated with Google and Apple products.


# Project Overview 

The main aim of this project is to analyze the tweet-product-dataset, obtained from Twitter. 

Through this analysis, we are to achieve the following: 

Identify some of the sentiments associated with the tweets of the various products. 

 Process the data and analyze it to determine its key characteristics. 
 
Come up with a model that accurately evaluates and predicts the sentiments towards given product lines.


### The project involves the following steps:
Data preparation: The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance.
Feature extraction: Various techniques are used to convert text reviews into numerical features that can be used by machine learning algorithms. These techniques include bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and word embeddings.
Model selection: Different machine learning algorithms are experimented with to find the best-performing model. These algorithms include logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks.
Model training and evaluation: The selected model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data. The model's performance is assessed using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Model deployment: Once the model is performing well, it is deployed to make predictions on new, unseen customer reviews. The model is integrated into a user-friendly interface or API for real-time sentiment analysis.

The goal of this project is to provide businesses with valuable insights into customer sentiment. This information can be used to make data-driven decisions, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance brand reputation.

In addition to the steps mentioned above, the following data preprocessing steps were performed:

Special characters were removed.
Stopwords were removed.
Tokenization was performed.
Lemmatization was used to reduce words to their common root form
Vectorization Techniques
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF Vectorizer)
Classification Models

# Evaluation

To evaluate our NLP sentiment analysis model, we used a variety of evaluation metrics to conduct thorough testing and analysis. The results of these evaluations provide insights into the effectiveness of our approach.
Here is a breakdown of the key terms in the original text:
Evaluate: To evaluate the performance of our Twitter sentiment analysis project
Performance: Evaluate the accuracy of our model to correctly classify tweets.
NLP sentiment analysis model: A model that can automatically customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
Evaluation metrics: Measures that are used to assess the performance of a model.
Insights: Understandings or realizations that are gained from our data.
